## Business Case:
We work for a real estate company like Windermere or Madrona. Our agents have a group of customers who are looking to sell their homes in the near future, but they would like to know what renovations to add to their homes in order to increase the value and get the most return on investment. Our 3 main questions:

  1. What factors influence price the most?
  2. What factors are feasible for renovation
  3. How accurately can we predict the value these features will have on price?
